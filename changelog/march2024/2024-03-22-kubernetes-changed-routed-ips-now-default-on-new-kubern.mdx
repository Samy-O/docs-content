[Routed IPs](https://www.scaleway.com/en/news/routed-ips-are-coming-to-all-scaleway-products/) are coming to all Scaleway products.
Effective now, new Kubernetes clusters will provision nodes with public IP addresses directly routed to the Instance, without having to go through a NAT gateway to convert from public IP to a private IP.

If you want to know more about the changes behind this evolution, take a look at our [blog post](https://www.scaleway.com/en/blog/ip-mobility-removing-nat/).
