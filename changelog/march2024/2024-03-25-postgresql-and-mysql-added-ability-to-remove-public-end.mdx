Network management on Managed DB for PostgreSQL and MySQL has been improved, and you can now add/remove public endpoints directly from the Scaleway console. This includes endpoints attached to both Database Instances and Read-Replicas.

Refer to [our documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/remove-public-endpoint/) for more information.
