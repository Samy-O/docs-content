The Network management on Managed DB for PostgreSQL and MySQL has been slightly revamped and you can now add/remove public endpoints directly from your Console, may it be those attached to Database Instances or Read-Replicas.

Refer to [this documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/managed-databases/postgresql-and-mysql/how-to/remove-public-endpoint/) for more information.
