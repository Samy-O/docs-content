      You can also access the search bar by typing Cmd + k on macOS and Ctrl + k on Linux or Windows.
    </Message>
3. Click in the search bar and enter the keyword you are looking for. The keyword can be a Name or an IP of a resource.
    <Message type="note">
     The search results are limited due to this being the initial version (V1). This initial version of the search bar may not yet include all resources and a "no result" message can appear despite the existence of the resource.
