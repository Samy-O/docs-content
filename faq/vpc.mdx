## What is the difference between VPC and a Private Network?

One default VPC (**V**irtual **P**rivate **C**loud) for every available region is automatically created in each Scaleway [Project](/identity-and-access-management/organizations-and-projects/concepts/#project). A VPC offers layer 3 network isolation.

Within each VPC, you can create multiple **Private Networks** and attach Scaleway resources to them, as long as the resources are in an AZ within the network's region. Attached resources can then communicate between themselves in an isolated and secure layer 2 network, away from the public internet.

In the future, VPC will allow you to define specific routing rules for your Private Networks, interconnect your VPC with other networks, define access control lists and more.

## Can two different Private Networks communicate with each other?

[VPC routing](/network/vpc/concepts#routing) allows you to automize the routing of traffic between resources in different Private Networks within the same VPC. This feature is currently in public beta and only available when creating a new VPC. In the future, it will be made available for existing VPCs, along with other features such as custom routes. See our [dedicated documentation](/network/vpc/how-to/manage-routing/).

## What happened to my classic, mono-AZ Private Network?
When VPC and regional Private Networks moved from Public Beta to General Availability, all mono-AZ Private Networks were automatically migrated to be regional. This is a seamless process with no downtime, that should not require any extra configuration on the client side. [Read the documentation](/network/vpc/reference-content/vpc-migration/) to find out more about the migration process.

## Do resources' IP addresses on a Private Network risk changing when allocated by managed DHCP?

With managed DHCP, the IP is allocated when the resource is attached to a Private Network, and released only when the resource is detached or deleted. The IP address remains stable across reboots and long poweroffs, and will not change except upon deletion or detachment from the Private Network.

## Can I route traffic between different Private Networks on the same VPC?

This is possible with the introduction of our [VPC routing](/network/concepts/#routing) feature. Managed routes allow a VPC to route traffic between the private IP addresses of resources attached to different Private Networks within the same VPC. This feature is currently in public beta, and can only be activated when you create a new VPC. We are planning to make it available on existing VPCs in the near future, along with other features such as custom routing.
